description: Installing and using React Developer Tools in Spotify.
---

To install React Developer Tools in Spotify:

1. Launch Spotify in the developer mode (and with the `--enable-chrome-runtime` flag if you are using **Spotify versions older than 1.2.34**; without it, React Developer Tools won't work)
2. Press *Ctrl + Shift + T*
3. Press *Ctrl + N*
4. Navigate to the React Developer Tools page on Chrome Web Store using the address bar: `https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi`
5. Press the "Add to Chrome" button
6. Confirm your choice

You may need to reload the client for the extension to work.

If you get an error saying that you're not allowed to install extensions, try using `Force enable Chrome extensions` feature of the ["CEF/Spotify Tweaks" Windhawk mod](https://windhawk.net/mods/cef-titlebar-enabler-universal).

You can find more info about React Developer Tools on the [official React website](https://react.dev/learn/react-developer-tools).
